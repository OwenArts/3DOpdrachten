# Three-Cushion Billiards

This is a C++ project that simulates the game of three-cushion billiards, where players aim to hit a ball against three cushions before it comes to a stop. The project utilizes OpenGL for 3D rendering and implements camera control using keyboard and mouse input.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd three-cushion-billiards
   ```

3. Install the necessary libraries and dependencies. *(Specify the required libraries, such as OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, and any other dependencies. Provide instructions for installing these libraries, such as using package managers like apt, brew, or manual installation.)*

4. Compile the project:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o three-cushion-billiards -lOpenGL -lGLFW -lGLM
   ```

5. Run the game:
   ```
   ./three-cushion-billiards
   ```

## Usage

* Explain how to play the game and which controls are used. For example:
  - Use the "a" and "d" keys or the left and right arrow keys to move the camera and aim the active player's ball.
  - Move the mouse to change the camera direction.
  - Click the mouse to fire the ball in the direction you are looking with the camera.
  - After each turn, the camera will move to the other ball, and it will be the second player's turn.

* Provide any additional instructions, gameplay rules, known issues, or limitations.

## Examples

* Include some code snippets to demonstrate the key parts of your implementation, such as camera control or the physics of ball movement.
